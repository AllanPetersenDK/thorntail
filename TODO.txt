- test keycloak integration using docker
- Some type of BOM to bring the bits together. Stick to 1 for now
- Switch to using https://github.com/agroal/agroal for datasources instead of Ironjacamar
- Pieces to implement:
  - JAX-RS Validation (may not be anything for this in the new world)
  - JMX ??
  - JSF (on the fence on this one)
  - Web Profile (this would require JSF, but maybe we can bundle into it so it's not used separately)
  - Topology (could still be useful even on OpenShift, have had some ideas about what else it could do)
  - Batch (JBeret) ??
  - MDBs (@MessageDriven POJOs are done)
  - Web Services ??
  - Hibernate Search
  - Infinispan
  - Kafka clients
- 'hollow' distributions for web/microprofile
- Ability to take OpenAPI spec doc and "link" to endpoint code. Similar to how vert.x does it
