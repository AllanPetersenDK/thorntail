. High priority

- test keycloak integration using docker
- Fuller testing of Java EE tech in testsuite
- Some type of BOM to bring the bits together. Maybe just 3 types: Stable, New/Experimental, Deprecated
- Pieces to implement:
  - MP REST Client
  - MP JWT
  - MP Fault Tolerance
  - MP Open Tracing
  - MP Open API
  - Bean Validation
  - Hibernate Validator
  - JAX-RS Validation (may not be anything for this in the new world)
  - JMX ??
  - JSF (on the fence on this one)
  - Web Profile (this would require JSF, but maybe we can bundle into it so it's not used separately)
  - Topology (could still be useful even on OpenShift, have had some ideas about what else it could do)
  - Batch (JBeret) ??
  - MDBs (@MessageDriven POJOs are done)
  - Web Services ??
  - Hibernate Search
  - Infinispan
  - Websocket (might be covered by undertow, but worth a test if nothing else)
  - Kafka clients
  - 'hollow' distributions for web/microprofile
  -- To support that, handle attach=true in the plugin.
