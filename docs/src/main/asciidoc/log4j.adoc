= Using log4j

== Problem
While {project_name} does not use http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html[log4j] directly, some of the libraries in your application may use it.
If you do not configure log4j in your application, all logging output, including
output from {project_name} will get swallowed, preventing you from seeing your logs.

== Solutions
The recommended solution is to specify the path to your log4j.properties file as a *log4j.configuration* system
property. In your parameters to your JVM you would specify it like this:

....
java -Dlog4j.configuration=log4j.properties
....

Please note, when using this method you can use any name you want for your properties file.

The other solution is to place a file name log *log4j.properties* in the default path for your classloader.
In a {project_name} application you can just place this file in the root of your source directory; typically
/src/main/java.
