[#component-jpa]
= JPA

The JPA component provides support for JPA `EntityManager` and `@PersistenceContext` resources.

.Configuration

`jpa._PersistenceUnitId_.trace`::
Enable tracing if `OpenTracing` is available. Acceptable values are `OFF`, `ALWAYS`, and `ACTIVE`.
By setting to `ACTIVE`, only usage of the `EntityManager` when there is already an active parent context will be traced.
