[#component-jaxrs]
= JAX-RS

The JAX-RS component provides support for the JAX-RS specification.
The application will be scanned for an `Application` component annotated with `@ApplicationPath`.
If the discovered application does not provide a list of resources, they will be automatically scanned and added to the application.

JSON-P and the POJO-to-JSON Jackson provider are implicitly available to JAX-RS applications.
