Don't cling to a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it.

.Mangling artifacts is dangerous

When you mangle and repackage a user's artifacts and dependencies, it can many times go awry.

.Don't replace Maven

Let Maven (or Gradle) handle the entirety of pulling dependencies. We cannot predict the topology of someone's repository managers, proxies and network.

.Classpaths are tricky

If different codepaths are required for executing from Maven, an IDE, a unit-test, and during production, you will have a *bad time*.

.Testability is important

A slow test is a test that is never willingly executed. PRs take forever to validate. Users like to be able to test their own code quickly and iteratively.

.Easily extensible means ecosystem

If it's entirely too difficult to extend the platform, the ecosystem will not grow. New integrations should be simple.
