Don't cling to a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it.

.Mangling artifacts is dangerous

When you mangle and repackage a user's artifacts and dependencies, it can many times go awry.

.Classpaths are tricky

If different codepaths are required for executing from Maven, an IDE, a unit-test, and during production, you will have a *bad time*.

.Testability is important

A slow test is a test that is never willingly executed. PRs take forever to validate. Users like to be able to test their own code quickly and iteratively.
