[#maven-plugin]
= Maven Plugin

The `{project_key}-maven-plugin` exists to make packaging your application easier.

.Basic Configuration

As with any Maven plugin, configuration occurs within your project's `pom.xml`

The plugin has one available goal: `package`.
The behavior of this goal is controlled by the plugin configuration, described below.


[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.jboss.unimbus</groupId>
  <artifactId>unimbus-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <configuration>
    <!-- configuration -->
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>package</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>

== Modes

The plugin can operate in two modes: _fat_ and _thin_, with _fat_ being the default.
The mode is selected by a `<mode>...</mode>` block within the plugin configuration, or by the `{project_key}.mode` property.

.fat
Produces an executable build that includes all dependencies and your application artifact.

.thin
Produces an executable build that includes all dependencies but _not_ your application artifact.

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  <mode>thin</mode>
</configuration>

== Formats

The plugin can produce three different types of executable distributions: _jar_, _dir_, and _zip_, with _jar_ being the default.
The format is selected by a `<format>...</format>` block within the plugin configuration, or by the `{project_key}.format` property.

.jar
Produces a fat jar (or _Ã¼berjar_) containing the cotnents defined by the _mode_ above.
The jar may be executed using normal `java -jar` commands.

.dir
Produces a directory containing the contents defined by the `mode` above, along with scripts to easily execute it. 
The _dir_ layout may be best suited for container-related pipelines, where all runtime support aspects are added to a base layer, and the topmost layer contains only the vanillia application artifact.
To achieve this method, `mode` should be configured to be `thin`.

.zip
Produces the same content as the _dir_ format, but as a `.zip` file.

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  <format>dir</format>
</configuration>

== `main()`

The plugin will attempt to discover an existing non-ambiguous `main(...)` within your application.
If it finds none, a default `main(...)` will be configured.
If it finds a single application-provided `main(...)`, it will be used.
If it finds multiple application-provided `main(...)` methods, an error will result.
To resolve an ambiguous `main(...)` error, a `mainClass` may be configured using a `<mainClass>...</mainClass>` block within the plugin configuration, or by the `{project_key}.mainClass` property.

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  <mainClass>com.mycorp.myapp.Main</mainClass>
</configuration>

== Other configuration

.Naming

The artifact produced will include the Maven classifier of `-bin`.
This classifier may be changed using the `<classifier>...</classifier>` configuration element, or `{project_key}.classifier` property.

The artifact will be named the same as the primary project artifact (according to `${project.finalName}`), unless a plugin configuration of `<finalName>...</finalName>` or a property of `{project_key}.finalName` is provided.

.Attaching

If the format is `jar` or `zip`, it will be attached to the Maven project, causing it to be built or deployed to the repository. 
If the format is `dir`, it can not be attached.

To disable attaching of a `jar` or `zip` build, a configuration block of `<attach>...</attach>` or property of `{project_key}.attach` may be set to `false`.

== Distribution Structure

.Directory and Zip

When `dir` or `zip` formats are selected, the layout of the resulting tree is relatively simple:

`bin/`::
Directory containing platform-specific scripts to execute the application.

`bin/run.sh`::
A Unix-compatible shell script for launching the application.
If the distribution was built as a `thin` distribution, the application archive must be provided in one of two ways:
* As an argument to the `run.sh` command.
* By placing it within the `app/` directory.

`app/`::
A directory to contain the application archive.
If the distribution was built as a `thin` distribution, this directory will be empty.
When using containers, the top-most layer may be responsible for placing the application archive in this location, or may mount the archive into this directory when run.

`lib/`::
Contains all dependencies for the application.
Care is taken to ensure last-modified timestamps of the contents of this directly do not change needlessly.

.Jar

When the `jar` format is selected, the contents of the jar are also relatively simple:

`*.jar`::
All `.jar` archives are placed within the root of the resulting `-bin.jar`.

`bin/Run.class`::
A bootstrapping class is provided which can set up the classpath given the contents at the root of the jar.
The bootstrap class will extract all of the `.jar` artifacts from the root to a cache directory at `$HOME/.{project_key}-cache`.
The extracted jars will have a SHA-1 hash added to their names in order to disambiguate any identically named jars from this or other applications, as the cache is shared.

`META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`::
The Jar manifest is configured to run the `bin.Run` main bootstrapping class when `java -jar` is used.
