= Flat Classpath

While Java application servers previously have had the ability to support multiple disparate applications, when building microservices, a runtime need only support a single application, or service.
With a microservices architecture, significantly fewer resources and capabilities may be required for each service.
Freely mixing service and application implementations becomes significantly less problematic and certainly less cumbersome.

That being said, the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) may become beneficial in the future after further adoption by other upstream projects.
